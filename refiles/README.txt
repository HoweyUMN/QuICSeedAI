We have performed some preliminary analysis (see the powerpoint in Results) using a small dataset from Stuart Lichtenberg and the Jupyter notebook RT_QuIC_combined_Stuart_data.ipynb. The purpose of this notebook is to investigate training a model that takes in 8 RT-QuIC curves representing a replicate set of wells evaluating a given sample. The output of this model is a positive or negative determination of the sample. Stuart's data has been labeled with positive or negative.

We have also discussed using data from Allen Herbst's dilution experiments to contribute to this model. In this case, we would use the computed 50% dilution threshold to split dilutions into positive and negative training samples. The input schema would be the same - replicate sets. 

It would be beneficial to obtain at least one additional dataset, and explore opportunities for transfer learning and evaluation on different types of holdout sets.
